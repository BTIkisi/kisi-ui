# kisi-ui
Kisi is a bitcoin wallet app that supports payments over the bitcoin, liquid and lightning networks. Try it out at coinos.io.  This repository contains the code for the frontend user interface which is a progressive web application built with VueJS. If you intend to run it yourself you'll also need to host an instance of coinos-server which provides a REST/Websocket API and interfaces with bitcoind, elementsd, and lnd.
